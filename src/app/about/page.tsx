              Hello, kindred spirit! I'm Laynie, a passionate floral artist and sacred ceremony guide 
              rooted in the enchanted high desert of Northern Arizona. Since the universe called me 
              to this path in 2018, I've been crafting botanical spells that honor the earth's wisdom 
              and celebrate life's most sacred moments. What began as a mystical winter's night 
              revelation has blossomed into my soul's true calling, and I'm blessed to share this 
              magical journey with you.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* How It All Began */}
          <div className="mb-16">
            <h2 className="font-serif text-4xl text-plum-800 mb-8 flex items-center">

              How the Magic Awakened
            </h2>
            <div className="bg-midnight-800/10 rounded-3xl p-8 backdrop-blur-sm">
              <p className="text-lg text-midnight-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The craft wasn't always my calling‚Äîthe ancestors had to whisper a little louder first. 
                During a snow-blessed Friday evening in late 2018, as the veil between worlds grew thin 
                with winter's embrace, my roommate and I found ourselves guided by divine boredom. 
                The snowfall had created a sacred cocoon around our home, and spirit urged us toward 
                the local craft sanctuary.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-midnight-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Never considering myself particularly gifted in the craft arts, I wandered the aisles 
                like a seeker in a temple. Then‚Äîas if by otherworldly guidance‚Äîa simple wreath base 
                called to my spirit. It whispered of Yule magic and winter blessings yet to come. 
                I gathered oak leaves for strength, winter blooms for hope, and returned home to 
                perform my first act of floral alchemy.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-midnight-700 leading-relaxed">
                To my wonder and delight, my maiden Christmas wreath emerged as a thing of beauty, 
                crackling with the energy I'd unknowingly woven into every placement. That moment 
                ignited a sacred fire I couldn't ignore. From there, the path revealed itself: 
                flower crowns to honor the divine feminine, corsages blessed with intention, 
                and wedding arbors that would witness love's most sacred vows‚Äîeach creation 
                deepening my communion with the plant spirits.

                <p className="text-midnight-700 leading-relaxed">
                  My journey flows from a deep reverence for Mother Earth's creative force and 
                  the ancient wisdom that joy is medicine for the soul. Each arrangement begins 
                  with gratitude‚Äîto the earth that nurtures each bloom, to the seasons that 
                  guide their timing, and to the divine feminine energy that flows through all 
                  growing things.

                  I craft durable talismans of beauty that honor both form and spirit. 
                  When the universe revealed that this sacred work could sustain my earthly 
                  needs, I knew I'd found my dharma‚Äîmy soul's true purpose.
