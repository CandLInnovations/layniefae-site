# 📸 Image Upload Setup for Product Management

## 🚀 What's Been Added

I've successfully added a complete image upload system to your admin dashboard! Here's what's new:

### ✨ Features Added:
1. **Drag & drop image upload** in the product creation form
2. **Multiple image support** (up to 5 images per product)
3. **Image preview** with alt text editing
4. **Primary image designation** (first image is primary)
5. **Image validation** (5MB limit, image files only)
6. **Supabase Storage integration** for reliable cloud storage

### 📁 Files Created/Modified:
- `src/components/ImageUpload.tsx` - New image upload component
- `src/app/admin/products/new/page.tsx` - Updated with image upload
- `src/app/api/admin/products/route.ts` - Updated to handle images
- `src/app/shop/page.tsx` - Updated to display uploaded images
- `supabase-storage-setup.sql` - Storage bucket setup script

## 🛠️ Next Steps: Complete the Setup

To fully activate the image upload feature, you need to set up the Supabase Storage bucket:

### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard → **Storage**
2. Click **Create a new bucket**
3. Name it: `product-images`
4. Set it as **Public bucket** (so images can be displayed)
5. Click **Create bucket**

### Step 2: Set Up Storage Policies (Alternative Method)

If you prefer to run the SQL script:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard → **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-storage-setup.sql`
3. Click **Run** to create the bucket and policies

### Step 3: Test the Upload Feature

1. Go to `/admin/products/new`
2. Scroll down to the **Product Images** section
3. Drag and drop an image or click to browse
4. Add alt text for accessibility
5. Create the product

## 🎉 How It Works

### Admin Side:
- **Upload**: Drag images directly into the upload area
- **Preview**: See thumbnails with edit-able alt text
- **Primary**: First image is automatically primary
- **Remove**: Click the × button to remove images

### Customer Side:
- **Display**: Images show on product cards in the shop
- **Hover**: Smooth zoom effect on hover
- **Fallback**: Beautiful default emoji if no image

### Storage:
- **Cloud Storage**: Images stored securely in Supabase
- **CDN**: Fast loading with Supabase's global CDN
- **Unique Names**: Automatic file naming prevents conflicts

## 🔧 Technical Details

### File Structure:
```
product-images/
  ├── 1234567890-abc123.jpg    (timestamp-random.ext)
  ├── 1234567891-def456.png
  └── ...
```

### Image Processing:
- **Automatic resize**: Browser handles client-side optimization
- **Format support**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Size limit**: 5MB per image
- **Validation**: File type and size checking

### Database Storage:
Images are stored in the `products.images` JSONB field as:
```json
[
  {
    "url": "https://your-project.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/product-images/...",
    "altText": "Product image description",
    "isPrimary": true,
    "sortOrder": 0
  }
]
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Security:
- ✅ **File type validation** prevents harmful uploads
- ✅ **Size limits** prevent storage abuse  
- ✅ **Admin-only uploads** through JWT authentication
- ✅ **Public viewing** for customer product display

### Performance:
- ✅ **CDN delivery** for fast loading
- ✅ **Lazy loading** in product grids
- ✅ **Optimized queries** from Supabase

### Accessibility:
- ✅ **Alt text support** for screen readers
- ✅ **Keyboard navigation** in upload interface
- ✅ **ARIA labels** for accessibility

## 🎯 What This Enables

### Immediate Benefits:
- 🖼️ **Professional product photos** instead of emoji placeholders
- 📱 **Mobile-friendly** drag and drop
- ⚡ **Fast loading** with CDN

### Future Enhancements Ready:

- 🏷️ **Image tagging** and categorization
- 📊 **Usage analytics** for popular images

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Upload failed"**
   - Check Supabase Storage bucket exists
   - Verify storage policies are set
   - Confirm file is under 5MB

2. **Images not showing**
   - Check bucket is set to public
   - Verify image URLs in database
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Slow uploads**
   - Large files take time
   - Check internet connection
   - Consider resizing images before upload

### Getting Help:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase Storage settings
- Test with small images first
